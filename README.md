# MATLAB Human Activity Recognition Project

Welcome to the MATLAB Human Activity Recognition Project. This repository is designed for the exploration and implementation of a MATLAB-based system to analyze and classify human activities like walking, running, upstairs, downstairs, and sitting. Utilizing sensor data, this project employs MATLAB's robust computational tools to accurately identify different activities, enhancing applications in health monitoring and user interaction.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of the "Live Brief Project Group 07" initiative, involving a collaborative effort to harness MATLAB's capabilities for practical and innovative applications. Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Collection:** Utilizing MATLAB Mobile for real-time acceleration data collection.
- **Feature Extraction:** Processing data to extract meaningful statistics and patterns.
- **Model Training and Validation:** Employing machine learning techniques within MATLAB to develop and refine predictive models.
- **Activity Monitoring Application:** Developing an interface for real-time activity monitoring.
